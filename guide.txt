HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM - SETUP GUIDE
=========================================

This guide will help you set up and run the Hospital Management System from scratch.

PREREQUISITES
=============

1. Python 3.8 or higher
2. MongoDB (Community Server)
3. Git (optional, for cloning the repository)

STEP 1: INSTALL MONGODB
========================

1. Download MongoDB Community Server from: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community
2. Install MongoDB following the installation wizard
3. Add MongoDB to your system PATH (usually done automatically during installation)
4. Create a data directory for MongoDB:
   - Windows: C:\data\db
   - Linux/Mac: /usr/local/var/mongodb or /data/db

STEP 2: START MONGODB SERVICE
==============================

Windows:
- Open Command Prompt as Administrator
- Run: net start MongoDB
- OR run MongoDB manually: mongod

Linux/Mac:
- Run: sudo systemctl start mongod
- OR run manually: mongod

Verify MongoDB is running:
- Open a new terminal/command prompt
- Run: mongo (or mongosh in newer versions)
- You should see the MongoDB shell prompt
- Type 'exit' to quit

STEP 3: CLONE OR DOWNLOAD THE PROJECT
=====================================

Option A - Clone with Git:
git clone <repository-url>
cd hospital_project

Option B - Download ZIP:
- Download the project ZIP file
- Extract to a folder
- Navigate to the project directory

STEP 4: SET UP PYTHON VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT
=========================================

1. Create virtual environment:
   python -m venv venv

2. Activate virtual environment:
   Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   Linux/Mac: source venv/bin/activate

   (You should see (venv) at the beginning of your command prompt)

STEP 5: INSTALL PYTHON DEPENDENCIES
===================================

1. Make sure virtual environment is activated
2. Install required packages:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   This will install:
   - Django==3.1.12
   - djongo==1.3.7 (MongoDB connector for Django)
   - pymongo==3.11.4
   - django-widget-tweaks==1.5.0
   - Other dependencies

STEP 6: SET UP THE DATABASE
===========================

1. Make sure MongoDB is running (from Step 2)
2. Run Django migrations to create database structure:
   python manage.py migrate

   This will create the necessary collections in MongoDB database 'hospital_db'

STEP 7: CREATE ADMIN USER
=========================

1. Create a superuser account:
   python manage.py createsuperuser

2. Follow the prompts:
   - Username: admin (or your preferred username)
   - Email: your-email@example.com
   - Password: choose a strong password

STEP 8: RUN THE DEVELOPMENT SERVER
===================================

1. Start the Django development server:
   python manage.py runserver

2. Open your web browser and go to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/

3. You should see the Hospital Management System homepage

STEP 9: TEST THE APPLICATION
============================

1. Register as a Patient or Doctor from the homepage
2. Login with your credentials
3. Test the features:
   - View appointments (filtered by user type)
   - Schedule new appointments (as patient)
   - Cancel appointments (as patient - with confirmation dialog)
   - View patient/doctor lists (admin features)

ADMIN FEATURES
==============

To access Django admin panel:
1. Go to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
2. Login with the superuser credentials you created
3. Manage users, patients, doctors, and appointments

TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

1. MongoDB Connection Issues:
   - Make sure MongoDB service is running
   - Check if port 27017 is available
   - Verify MongoDB is installed correctly

2. Python Dependencies Issues:
   - Make sure virtual environment is activated
   - Try: pip install --upgrade pip
   - Reinstall requirements: pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Migration Issues:
   - Delete the database and start fresh: drop database hospital_db in MongoDB shell
   - Run migrations again: python manage.py migrate

4. Port Already in Use:
   - Kill existing server: Ctrl+C in the terminal running the server
   - Or run on different port: python manage.py runserver 8001

5. CSS/Static Files Not Loading:
   - Run: python manage.py collectstatic
   - Make sure DEBUG=True in settings.py for development
